zlib.js
=======

zlib.js is a Javascript implementation of the zlib format and the deflate algorithm. The initial goal is to have a working decompressor, but perhaps a compressor will eventually be written as well. 


Future
------

This project has been extracted from another project, but that project no longer needs client-side zlib decompression. Rather than lose the code, I thought I would release it as-is. It is my intention to eventually revisit this project, finish the incomplete parts, and add a test suite.
